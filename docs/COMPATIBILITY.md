# Compatibility

What a J2ME title can rely on, what it cannot, and why. This file is meant to be
read *before* debugging a game: most "the emulator is broken" reports turn out
to be one of the gaps listed here, and knowing which one saves an afternoon.

## Profiles and configurations

| | Status |
|---|---|
| CLDC 1.1 (JSR 139) | implemented |
| CLDC 1.0 | implemented — the runtime is a superset; class files with major version 45–48 load unchanged |
| MIDP 2.0 (JSR 118) | implemented, see the API table below |
| MIDP 1.0 | implemented — every 1.0 call exists in 2.0 |
| JSR 75 (FileConnection/PIM) | not implemented, not planned |
| JSR 82 (Bluetooth) | not implemented |
| JSR 120/205 (messaging) | not implemented |
| JSR 135 (Mobile Media) | tone playback only; no sampled audio or video |

Anything not implemented raises. That is deliberate: a
`java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` naming the method is a five-minute fix, whereas a
silently-ignored call is a two-day one.

## Class file support

The loader accepts major versions 45 through 49 and does not verify. No
verifier is needed because an interpreter cannot be talked into memory
unsafety the way a JIT can — but every array access, cast and stack-depth
assumption is still checked at run time, so malformed input raises a Java error
rather than corrupting C state.

## Verified titles

`tools/fetch_test_games.sh` pulls the published binaries for *J2ME Games with
MIDP 2* (Apress, 2004), built by javac 1.4 targeting CLDC 1.0 - class file
version 46, with the legacy jsr/ret finally blocks a 2004 toolchain emitted.

Every title is run by `tools/run_game_corpus.sh`, which tries a list of screen
sizes per title and records which one worked - the gates differ, and a title
that rejects one size is not a broken title. Tumbleweed is the strict one:

    if (DISP_WIDTH < 150 || DISP_HEIGHT < 170) throw new Exception("Screen too small");
    if (DISP_WIDTH > 250 || DISP_HEIGHT > 250) throw new Exception("Screen too large");

so it wants 176x208. It renders its own error Alert, correctly, at anything
outside that - which is how the gate was found.

| Title | Class | Size | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tumbleweed (`jump.jar`) | `net.frog_parrot.jump.Jump` | 176x208 | **plays**: scrolling ground, an animated sprite, a live score and a countdown - [screenshot](images/tumbleweed.png) |
| Maze (`maze.jar`) | `net.frog_parrot.maze.Maze` | 176x208 | **runs**: generates and draws a maze with the player marker - [screenshot](images/maze.png) |
| Hello (`hello.jar`) | `net.frog_parrot.hello.Hello` | 176x208 | **runs**: draws "Hello World!" (a legitimately static screen) |
| Dungeon (`book{5,6,7}.jar`) | `net.frog_parrot.dungeon.Dungeon` | 176x208 | **plays**: a platformer with tiled walls, keys, a door and a timer - [screenshot](images/dungeon.png) |
| Platformer (`book4.jar`) | `net.frog_parrot.jump.Jump` | 176x208 | **plays**: the same Tumbleweed game at a later stage of the book |

`tools/run_game_corpus.sh` is the gate over all of them: it fails on "not a
MIDlet suite", "could not start", an uncaught exception, "nothing ever
presented" or a single flat colour, and reports - without failing - whether the
picture changes, because a title is allowed to be static. Current result: 7
passed, 0 failed.  The later chapters all build to `book.jar`, so they are
stored by chapter.

All three parse and link with zero failures. Tumbleweed is the demanding one: it
uses `GameCanvas`, `LayerManager`, `Sprite` with frame animation, `TiledLayer`,
`Font` metrics, `Image` loading from the JAR, a background game-loop thread, and
`System.getProperty` - and it is the title that found most of the bugs listed at
the bottom of [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

It also gates itself on the device, which is worth knowing when trying it:

```java
DISP_WIDTH  = getWidth();
DISP_HEIGHT = getHeight();
if (DISP_WIDTH < 150 || DISP_HEIGHT < 170) throw new Exception("Screen too small");
```

so run it with `--size 176x208` or larger; at 240x320 it refuses with its own
Alert (which the runtime renders correctly, title bar and all).

Specifically supported:

- `long` and `double` throughout, including the two-slot stack discipline
- legacy `jsr` / `ret` (old toolchains emit these for `finally`)
- `tableswitch`, `lookupswitch`, `multianewarray`
- `checkcast`, `instanceof`, `athrow`, `monitorenter` / `monitorexit`
- modified UTF-8 (CESU-8) constants, including embedded NULs
- class file attributes that matter (`Code`, `ConstantValue`); the rest skipped

## API coverage

### java.lang

| Class | Status |
|---|---|
| `Object` | complete (`hashCode` is a stable identity hash) |
| `String` | complete; both the embedded and the wrapped representation |
| `StringBuffer` | complete |
| `StringBuilder` | present as a `StringBuffer` subclass — not in CLDC, but every modern javac lowers `a + b` to it |
| `Math` | complete, plus `cbrt`/`rint` beyond CLDC |
| `System` | `currentTimeMillis`, `nanoTime`, `arraycopy`, `identityHashCode`, `gc`, `exit`, `getProperty`, `out`, `err` |
| `Thread`, `Runnable` | green threads, `sleep`, `join`, `yield`, `wait`/`notify` on `Object` |
| `Throwable` and the full exception hierarchy | complete, with `toString`/`getMessage`/`printStackTrace` |
| `Class` | `getName`, `isArray`, `isInterface`, `isInstance`, `getSuperclass`, `forName` |
| `Integer`/`Long`/`Short`/`Byte`/`Character`/`Boolean`/`Float`/`Double` | constructors, `*Value`, `parseInt`, `toString(radix)`, `toHexString`, `valueOf` |
| `Runtime` | `gc`, `freeMemory`, `totalMemory`, `exit` |

`System.getProperty` answers for `microedition.platform`, `.configuration`,
`.profiles`, `.locale`, `.encoding`, `line.separator`, `java.version`. Anything
else returns `null`, which is what a real device does for unknown keys.

### java.util

`Vector`, `Hashtable`, `Random` (the 48-bit LCG, so sequences match a real
device), `Date`, `Calendar`, `TimeZone` (UTC), `Stack`, `Enumeration`,
`Timer`/`TimerTask` (driven by the VM scheduler, so background timers work),
`NoSuchElementException`, `EmptyStackException`.

`Calendar` does real calendar arithmetic; `TimeZone` is UTC-only, so a game that
displays local time will show UTC.

### java.io

`InputStream`, `OutputStream`, their `Data*` subclasses (big-endian, modified
UTF-8 via `readUTF`/`writeUTF`), `ByteArrayInputStream`,
`ByteArrayOutputStream`, `PrintStream`, and the `IOException` hierarchy.

`Reader`/`Writer` are **not** implemented. A title that uses
`InputStreamReader` will fail; this is rare in practice because CLDC has no
`java.io.Reader` at all, so a well-behaved MIDlet never refers to one.

### javax.microedition.io

`Connector.open` for `file://` only. Networking raises
`ConnectionNotFoundException` rather than pretending: there is no socket stack
on a bare-metal target, and a game that silently gets a null stream from
`http://` is harder to diagnose than one that throws.

### javax.microedition.lcdui

`Display`, `Displayable`, `Canvas`, `Graphics` (the complete drawing API),
`Image`, `Font`, `Command`, `Ticker`, `Alert`, `AlertType`, `Form`, `List`,
`TextBox`, `Item`, `StringItem`, `ImageItem`, `Gauge`, `ChoiceGroup`,
`TextField`, `DateField`, `Spacer`, and the three listener interfaces.

`Graphics` implements all three overloads of `drawString`, `drawRegion`,
`drawRGB`, `copyArea`, alpha blending, XOR mode, dotted strokes, rounded
rectangles and arcs with MIDP's counter-clockwise degree convention.

### javax.microedition.lcdui.game

`GameCanvas`, `Layer`, `LayerManager`, `Sprite`, `TiledLayer` — including all
eight transforms, reference-pixel arithmetic in the rotated coordinate space,
frame sequences, animated tiles, and **pixel-level collision detection** that
uses the same transform as drawing (a mismatch there produces collisions that
do not match what the player sees, which is the classic bug in this area).

### javax.microedition.rms

`RecordStore` with real persistence through the port's file hooks, so a high
score survives a restart. `RecordEnumeration` is implemented; listeners are
accepted and ignored.

One file per store is written to `nj_port.rms_dir` (the working directory when
it is `NULL`), named `<store>.rms`. These are the player's saves, not project
files: point `--rms-dir` somewhere disposable while developing, and never commit
them. `*.rms` is gitignored for that reason.

### javax.microedition.media

`Manager.playTone` and tone `Player`s, routed through `nj_port.tone_play`. No
sampled audio, no video. A game with music will be silent; a game with beeps
will not.

## javax.microedition.media

Implemented, and tested end to end by `tests/test_audio.c` (24 assertions)
driving `tests/fixtures/audiodemo.jar`, built by `tools/make_audio_jar.sh`.

| | |
|---|---|
| `Manager` | `createPlayer(InputStream,String)`, `createPlayer(String)`, `getSupportedContentTypes/Protocols`, `playTone`, `TONE_STOP`/`TONE_BLOCKING`/`TONE_CONSTANT_DURATION`, `TONE_DEVICE_LOCATOR` |
| `Player` | the full state machine, `realize`/`prefetch`/`start`/`stop`/`deallocate`/`close`, `setLoopCount`, `getState`/`getDuration`/`getMediaTime`, `add`/`removePlayerListener`, `getControl(s)` |
| `PlayerListener` | `started`, `stopped`, `closed`, with the event strings interned so the reference comparison the javadoc recommends actually works |
| `ToneControl` | real JSR-135 parsing: big-endian length, note/duration triples, malformed input refused at `realize()` rather than mid-frame |
| `VolumeControl` | `setLevel`/`getLevel`/`setMute`/`isMuted` |
| WAV | RIFF/WAVE PCM, 8- and 16-bit, mono and stereo, from a stream or a JAR resource |

`TONE_BLOCKING` blocks the CALLING JAVA THREAD cooperatively: it returns
`NJ_ERR_TIMEOUT` and the interpreter suspends that thread, exactly as
`Thread.sleep()` does. Sleeping the C thread instead would freeze every other
thread in the VM, which for a game means the picture stops.

**Not implemented, and refused by name rather than silently:** `http://` and
`rtsp://` raise `MediaException` naming the protocol. There is no MIDI, no video,
no audio capture, and no custom controls beyond the two above.

**The headless port records sound instead of playing it** - tone calls, tones
offered, stops, PCM opens, frames accepted, device format - so a test can assert
that a MIDlet asked for the right notes in the right order without a sound card.
A port with no audio leaves the hooks NULL and sound does not play, which is not
an error.

**The SDL2 port really plays it.** Tones are synthesised as square waves - which
is what the format sounds like, a sine would be prettier and wrong - and queued
with `SDL_QueueAudio`, so a one-second tone does not stop the frame loop for a
second. `pcm_free()` reports the queue depth so a long WAV is throttled rather
than buffered without bound. Verified headless with SDL's dummy driver, which is
the one check that distinguishes "the game is silent" from "the device never
opened":

    SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy \
        build/nj2me --port sdl2 tests/fixtures/audiodemo.jar
    INFO: audio: dummy opened, 22050 Hz, 1 channel(s)
    INFO: AUDIO wav=200000 state=400

## Known behavioural differences

| Area | Difference |
|---|---|
| Threads | cooperative, switched at an instruction-count boundary. A tight loop with no allocation or I/O still yields (the quantum is enforced), but a thread that never blocks cannot be preempted *mid-instruction* — irrelevant for correctness, occasionally visible in interleaving |
| `synchronized` | compiles and runs, but does not lock: a cooperatively scheduled thread is never preempted inside a critical section |
| `Object.wait`/`notify` | implemented; a `wait` with no notifier left is detected and the game is reported as finished rather than hanging |
| `System.exit` | stops the VM cleanly and the code reaches the host |
| `Class.forName` | works for classes the archive actually contains plus the built-in library |
| Reflection | absent, as in CLDC |
| Networking | `file://` only |
| `TimeZone` | UTC only |
| Locale | `en-US` fixed; `toLowerCase`/`toUpperCase` are ASCII-only |
| Fonts | three built-in bitmap sizes from Liberation Mono; CJK needs a glyph provider installed through the font fallback hook |
| Image size limits | 8192 px per axis, checked in 64-bit before any allocation |

## Codec coverage

Decoding goes through a registry
([`include/nj2me/nj_codec.h`](../include/nj2me/nj_codec.h)) so a platform can
substitute a hardware decoder; see [PORTING.md](PORTING.md).

| Format | Built in | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PNG | yes | all colour types, bit depths 1–16, Adam7 interlacing, `tRNS` |
| JPEG | adapter ready | a software baseline decoder is optional; without one, a JPEG fails with an actionable message rather than being mis-detected |
| GIF | no | a provider can be installed |
| BMP | no | a provider can be installed |

Benchmark titles overwhelmingly use PNG for sprite art. JPEG appears mostly for
splash screens and photographic backgrounds, which is why it is the first thing
to hand to a hardware block.

## Reporting a gap

The failure modes are designed to name themselves:

```
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: javax/microedition/lcdui/Form.append
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: <init>
link com/example/Game: superclass not found: javax/microedition/lcdui/Canvas
link com/example/Game: interface this runtime does not provide: java/lang/Runnable
```

Run `tools/nj_inspect game.jar --parse-only` first: if that is clean, the class
files are fine and the problem is an API gap, which the message will name.
